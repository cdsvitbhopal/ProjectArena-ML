# MRI Brain Tumor Diagnosis using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project focuses on the detection of brain tumors using deep learning techniques. It employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built using the TensorFlow Keras framework. The aim of the model is to accurately diagnos the tumor in the brain based on four classes that is 
1. Glioma
2. Meningioma 
3. No Tumor 
4. Pituitary
## Problem Statement
Brain tumors are a serious medical condition that require timely detection and treatment. Manual analysis of MRI scans for tumor detection is a time-consuming and error-prone task. This project addresses the challenge of automating the detection process using deep learning techniques to improve the efficiency and accuracy of tumor identification.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a CNN model that can accurately classify brain MRI images into four classes of tumor including a healthy brain. By automating the detection process, we aim to provide a reliable tool for assisting medical professionals in diagnosing brain tumors more efficiently.
