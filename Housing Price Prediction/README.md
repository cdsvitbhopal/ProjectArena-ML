# Housing Price Prediction Model

Welcome to the Housing Price Prediction model. This machine learning model is designed to predict housing prices using a dataset of various features related to houses. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this project serves as a great starting point to delve into machine learning for real estate.

## Usage Guide
- Once the setup is complete, you can use the Housing Price Prediction model with ease:

- Data Preparation: Make sure you have a dataset prepared in the same format as the example data provided. Ensure that the features match the columns used during training.

- Model Loading: If you want to use a pre-trained model, update the model_path variable in predict_prices.py to point to the location of your saved model.

- Prediction: Run the prediction script using the command mentioned in the setup. The model will output predicted housing prices based on the input features.

- Interpret Results: Analyze the predicted prices and assess the model's performance. You can further fine-tune the model parameters or features to improve its accuracy.

## Model Details
The Housing Price Prediction model is built upon the Scikit-Learn library, utilizing powerful regression techniques. It's designed to predict housing prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more. The model has been trained on a real-world dataset, allowing it to provide valuable insights into housing market trends.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing this model is not included in this repository due to its size. You can find the dataset and its description in Chapter X of "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron. Please download the dataset from the provided source and ensure it's appropriately formatted before use.
