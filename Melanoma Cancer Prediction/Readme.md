# Melanoma Cancer Detection using DenseNet

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a robust system for the early detection of melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer, using deep learning techniques. The model leverages DenseNet architecture implemented using the TensorFlow Keras framework. Melanoma detection is critical for timely diagnosis and treatment, as early intervention significantly improves patient outcomes.

## Problem Statement
Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, and its early detection is vital for successful treatment. However, visual diagnosis by medical professionals can be subjective and prone to errors. This project addresses the challenge of automating melanoma detection using deep learning algorithms to enhance accuracy and efficiency.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a DenseNet-based model capable of accurately classifying skin lesion images into malignant (melanoma) or benign categories. By automating the detection process, the aim is to provide a reliable tool to assist dermatologists and medical professionals in early melanoma diagnosis.

## About DenseNet
DenseNet (Densely Connected Convolutional Networks) is a neural network architecture proposed by Gao Huang et al. in their paper "Densely Connected Convolutional Networks" (CVPR 2017). Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), where each layer is connected only to the subsequent layer, DenseNet connects each layer to every subsequent layer within a dense block. This dense connectivity facilitates feature reuse, reduces the number of parameters, and encourages feature propagation throughout the network. DenseNet architectures typically consist of multiple dense blocks separated by transition layers, which control the growth of feature maps and reduce dimensionality.
